//! MLI intends to provide modern, data-driven abstractions for machine learning.
//!
//! MLI provides traits that work much like Combine's `Parser` in that one should only
//! need to have to create tensor processing primitives and then string them together to craft
//! a large system that continues to be useful as a primitive in an even larger system.
//!
//! To understand MLI, we actually just need to go over some basic Rust concepts.
//!
//! In Rust, the following relationships relate the owned versions of data with the borrowed versions:
//! - `T` -> `&mut T` -> `&T`
//! - `Vec<T>` -> `&mut [T]` -> `&[T]`
//! - `String` -> `&mut str` -> `&str`
//! - `FnOnce` -> `FnMut` -> `Fn`
//!
//! Most people don't think about the last one, because it is a trait, but it is critical to understand.
//! A `FnOnce` owns its enclosed environment. It can implement `FnMut` because since it owns the environment,
//! it can create a `&mut` to it. Similarly, a `FnMut` has a mutable borrow to its environment, thus it can
//! downgrade that mutable borrow to an immutable borrow.
//!
//! In MLI, the equivalent is:
//! - `Graph` -> `&mut Graph` -> `&Graph`
//!
//! Let us decompose the notion of what a compute graph is. A compute graph simply takes several inputs,
//! produces several intermediary outputs, and then produces the actual outputs. Each one of these
//! intermediary outputs is important because they affect the gradients of the functions that came after them.
//! If we discard them, then they will have to be recomputed from the input. If we only have a simple
//! convolution operation as our whole graph, there are no intermediary computations, just the
//! input and the output. However, we are more likely to have several layers of convolution, activation
//! functions, splitting, and merging. If we have just two layers of convolution with no activation function,
//! the first layer produces an output which is necessary to calculate the gradient `ùõøoutput/ùõøfilter`.
//!
//! We would like to have an abstraction that treats a whole graph, its inputs, intermediary computations, and
//! its outputs, the same way we would treat a single simple static function like a `tanh`. We would also like
//! that abstraction to be zero-cost and ideally parallel.
//!
//! This is where the magic happens. The traits [`Forward`] and [`Backward`] only require a `&self` as an
//! argument. This is because they use the trainable variables immutably to do a forward and backward
//! propogation. The trainable variables within the graph are stored as the [`Backward::TrainDelta`] type.
//! This means that if we have a graph composed of [`Forward`] and [`Backward`] items, we can compute
//! all of the deltas for a batch without ever mutating the graph, thus we can compute all of the deltas
//! **in parallel** for each batch. Since the learning rate is intended to be incorporated into the
//! delta before hand, you can just sum all of the deltas in the batch and train the network.
//!
//! The network which is trained though can't possibly be the one we distributed to all the threads,
//! however, due to Rust's ownership and borrowing. This is where the references come in.
//! The `Graph` is trainable since we can mutate it. The `&Graph` immutably borrows
//! the `Graph`, which we can propogate [`Forward`] and [`Backward`] across
//! multiple threads. We can then sum all of the deltas from the threads when they are done and then
//! update the `Graph`, which is no longer borrowed.
//!
//! Currently there are three main traits:
//! - [`Forward`]
//!     - Implemented on anything that can go into a forward graph.
//!     - Outputs intermediary computations (to compute gradients later) and final output.
//! - [`Backward`]
//!     - Implemented on anything that can go into a backward graph.
//!     - Propogates gradients backwards through the neural network.
//!     - This is provided the original input and any intermediary computations.
//!     - Propogates the change from the output to the input and trainable variables.
//!     - Is `&self` and does not do the actual training, so this can be ran in parallel.
//! - [`Train`]
//!     - Implemented on anything that can go into a training graph.
//!     - Uses the change to update the trainable variables.
//!         - Change can be normalized across a mini-batch before being passed.
//!     - Implemented on the `mutable` version of the graph.
